# atto - a basic text editor
Making a text editor made me realize what all is happening in the background which I do not see.
It actually amazes me that we have to take care of so many things before we even start to take input from the keyboard.

#### Day 1: 
I have always make to compile but this was my first time writing a Makefile to compile the code.

#### Day 2:
I never knew that so many things are going inside a terminal and handling those cases made me learn about:
- Flags
- Canonical Mode and Raw Mode
- and, How to handle the above modes
